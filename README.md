# Dynamic-registration-form
This project is a dynamic web application designed to manage travel registrations. It features a responsive frontend interface created with HTML and CSS, connected to a robust backend built with PHP. The application captures user details (Name, Age, Gender, Email, Phone, and Remarks) and securely stores them in a MySQL database via phpMyAdmin.
